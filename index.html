    <h1>Welcome! I'm Manami Roy</h1>
    <p>I am a <a href="https://ccapp.osu.edu/people/roy.516" target="_blank">CCAPP Fellow</a> at <a href="https://ccapp.osu.edu/" target="_blank">the Center for Cosmology and AstroParticle Physics</a>, The Ohio State University since September, 2023. Before that, I finished my Ph.D. in Astrophysics from Raman Research Institute, India in August, 2023. 
    My research interests include (not limited to!) the physics of the <strong>circumgalactic medium (CGM)</strong> 
    and its impact on <strong>galaxy evolution</strong>. I explore these questions from two complementary angles: by running <strong>idealized galaxy simulations</strong> that isolate key physical processes, and by developing semi-analytical models that capture the underlying physics. In particular, I study how <strong>cosmic rays</strong> modify the dynamical and thermal structure of the CGM.
Another central theme of my research is the origin and distribution of the hot, <strong>super-virial</strong> gas phase in the CGM. By examining both idealized setups and large cosmological simulations, I aim to build a coherent picture of how this newly discovered phase emerges and what it tells us about galaxy evolution.
